Lab 8

A makefile is included. After compiling type ./queue to run the program

The menu will appear which is the same as the one provided by the 
instructor. 

Note that if you choose to display the contents of the queue, the
items will be deleted. (TA said this was alright in the lab 8 discussion
board). 

I chose to include the QueueNode structure within the Queue class.
