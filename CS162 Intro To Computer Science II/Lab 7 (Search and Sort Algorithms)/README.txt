I chose to implement all of the requirements for Lab 7 into one program. A makefile is included which
creates an .exe file called "search". The citations for each function are included in their function
headers.

Included are the four files from part 1 of the lab:

1.original.txt (random list of integers from 1-9 with no 0 included)
2.early.txt (the list of integers from original.txt, with a 0 included early in the list)
3.middle.txt (the list of integers from original.txt, with a 0 included around the middle of the list)
4.late.txt (the list of integers from original.txt, with a 0 included latein the list)

There is also a file for part 4 of the lab called "sorted.txt" which contains a sorted list of 
integers from 0 to 9 to be used with the binary search function.

Upon starting the program you will be asked which task you want to perform: 

Option 1 corresponds to part 2 of the lab and runs the linear search function.
Option 2 corresponds to part 4 of the lab and runs the binary search function.
Option 3 corresponds to part 3 of the lab and sorts one of the previously mentioned files.

Options 1 and 3 will then prompt you if you want to use the early, middle or late files mentioned above.

If you choose to run the sort function, the program will ask you to enter a name for the output file!
