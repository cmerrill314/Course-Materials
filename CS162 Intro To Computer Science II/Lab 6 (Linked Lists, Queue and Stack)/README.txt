A makefile is included, the executable filename is "structures". 

The program will first ask you if you want to create a Stack-like
or Queue-like structure, at which point you enter 1 or 2 (or 3 to
exit).

Then you will be asked whether or not you want to push or pop,
where you will enter 1 or 2 again. 

I chose to display the contents of the list after pushing or 
popping so that it was a little bit easier to tell what was 
going on!
