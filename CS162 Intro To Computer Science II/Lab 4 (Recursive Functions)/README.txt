README:

A makefile is included, although all of the code is contained within one cpp file: lab4.cpp

If you use the makefile, run the program using ./lab4

The main menu will appear and you have four options:
Enter 1 to run the string reversal function (it will prompt you to enter a string).
Enter 2 to run the array sum function (it will prompt you to enter in integers one by one, and enter S to stop).
Enter 3 to run the triangular number function (it will prompt you to enter a single integer).
Enter 4 to exit.

Once a function is finished, the main menu will appear again and you can choose another option!
