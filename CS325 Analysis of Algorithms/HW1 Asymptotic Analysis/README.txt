My files were written in C++. To compile, type:

g++ mergesort.cpp -o merge

AND

g++ insertsort.cpp -o insert

then run each file by typing:

./merge
./insert

(You must have a file named data.txt in the directory for this to work)

At this point two files will be created, merge.out and insert.out

These will contain the sorted results of your data.txt file!
